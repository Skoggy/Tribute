<p> Wolverine is a fictional character from Marvel Comics, created by Roy Thomas, Len Wein and John Romita Sr. His name is James Howlett, however he normally goes by the name Logan. His first appearance was in a <em>Hulk</em> comic in 1974. He was in the X-Men comic books mostly, however it wasn't until 1988 that he stared in his own solo comic book series, which continues today.<br><br>
  
<p>  All mutants have powers, and Wolverine is no different. His primary power is an accelerated healing process, however he also possesses retractable claws in his forearms, sharp canine teeth and also a heightend sense of sight, smell and hearing.<br><br>
  
<p> His character originally was born in Canada in the 1880's, and due to his accelerated healing, has lived far longer than a normal human, and today appears as if he is a human in their physical prime. He fought in both World Wars, before joining a military program where the strongest metal adamantium was bonded to his bones, giving him his now famous metal claws instead of the old bone ones. However in the process he lost most of his memories.<br><br<>
  
 <p> He eventually ended up being recruited by Charles Xavier to the X-Men where Xavier, using his psycic abilities helped him to regain his memories.
